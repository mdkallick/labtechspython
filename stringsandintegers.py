## Introduction to strings, integers, and floating-point integers

# Strings and integers are very simple, but will make up most of the variables that you create. An integer is exactly the same as an integer in math: a number, without any decimal points after it. The general output of python math equations will be an integer, rounded down.
# Strings are simply anything that you surround by quotation marks. For example, "Hello World" is a string. A less intuitive string is something like "6". While it looks like a number to you, python cannot use this for math. "6" + 2 makes no sense to python.
# Floating point integers are simply integers but with decimal points.
