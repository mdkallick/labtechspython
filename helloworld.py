## Python tutorial for the command "print"

# This is the first thing that you will learn, and usually seen as
# the most standard first step in any programming language.
# The most basic command in python is print. This command will display text.
# For example, the command
print "Hi"
                                                                                                                            print "Hello World"
# should output the word Hi. It will not output "Hi", Print "Hi" or anything
# else. You do need to be extremely specific in terms of how you write this
# command, however.
# Print "Hi"
# print hi
# print "hi
# "
# will not work. These will give you a syntax error. Syntax errors are both
# the most common bug and the easiest to fix. This error simply means that
# there is something wrong with how you typed the command. Computers are very
# specific about how they interpret code.

# Now, try to make the python shell display the words Hello World. This
# should be a one line code. If you do this properly, you have just typed the 
# first command that anyone learns when learning python.
# Since this is leading up to writing loops, I will point out that the print
# command is the command that is most likely to be part of your loop.

# By the way, if you run this program, you will see an example of the print
# command in action.
